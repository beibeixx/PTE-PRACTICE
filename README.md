# PTE Practice App

A personal web app I made for myself to practice PTE exam's RS and WFD questions.

## What is this?
This is my personal tool to practice:
- Repeat Sentence (RS): Listen and check answers
- Write from Dictation (WFD): Type what I hear and check spelling

## How to run it
1. Install Node.js
2. Run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
3. Open http://localhost:3000

Made with React + Web Speech API
